Submit all homework questions using the following format. Questions submitted using other methods may not be answered. Please only ask about one problem at a time.

You must complete these fields:
* Problem Statement
* Attempted Solution
* Error Message

The following field is optional: extra information (screenshots)

# Problem Statement

Please provide a clear (and thorough) explanation of the problem. Include any text from the homework problem that is either unclear or related to the problem you're trying to solve. For example, if a problem was:

```text
Write a C++ program to add two numbers together and print out their square root
```

And you were having difficulty with printing out square root, your problem statement should read:
```text
Having difficulty with "print out their square root". What should I do for complex numbers?
```

# Attempted Solution

Paste in any code that directly relates to an attempted solution to your problem. For example, given the square root problem, you should paste in:
```c++
if (num>0){
	cout<<x = pow(num,1.2)
}else{
	cout<<x=pow(-1*num,1.2)<<"i"<<;
}
```

# Error Message

Paste in any error messages or strange output or very thoroughly describe what is going wrong. For the square root problem, you'd submit something like

```bash
no values are printing out but i is 
```

# Extra Information

Upload any screenshots that may help explain the error or misunderstanding.
